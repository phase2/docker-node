# CONTRIBUTING

## Node v4 and Node v6

These images are only accepting bugfixes.

## Node v8+

The directory contents for these Node versions are generated by the
templating process.

* **Changing the Dockerfile:** Modify `./Dockerfile.template`.
* **Changing copied resources:** Modify the contents of `./common/`

### Modifying a Docker Image

1. Make changes to the templates.
2. Navigate to the repo root.
3. Run `./template.sh` or `./template.sh {version}`

The results of the templating process should be committed to the repository.

### Adding a New Node Version

Create an empty directory named as the Node version number. It must be a version
that matches the available alpine variants of [the official node image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node).

Run `./template.sh` to initialize the directory with a Docker image manifest.

## Test Your Changes

Ensure the Dockerfile continues to build and that you can run it to access the
Node REPL.
